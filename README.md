# 🌟 Hey there! I'm Hlib 👋

I'm a Project Manager and Data Analyst dedicated to making complex IT projects run smoothly, deliver measurable value, and finish strong. I bring over seven years of experience to the table, ensuring technical strategies align perfectly with business outcomes.

My Approach
Since 2018, I've had the fantastic opportunity to work behind the scenes in both large outsourcing firms and nimble product companies. This diverse experience gives me an insider's view on effective operational processes in organizations of all sizes.

Core Strengths & Experience
Project Leadership: Successfully managed project roadmaps and organized cross-functional teams, applying methodologies like Agile/Scrum and leveraging tools such as Notion, ClickUp, and Trello to drive timely delivery.

Data & System Analysis: I go beyond management by diving into the data. I use MySQL and Athena to analyze customer information, diagnose system bottlenecks, and manage the creation of solutions that significantly enhance performance and loading times.

Operational Resilience: Practical experience managing enterprise IT infrastructure, security, and maintenance across major cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) and Linux systems.

Industry Focus
My professional playground includes the fast-paced worlds of Banking, E-commerce, Sports, and IT/Support.

Let's build something great together.
